 abstract = {The covariance structure of a multivariate normal population can be simplified by setting elements of the inverse of the covariance matrix to zero. Reasons for adopting such a model and a rule for estimating its parameters are given in section 2. It is also proposed to select the zeros in the inverse from sample data. A numerical illustration of the proposed technique is given in section 3. Appendix A sketches the general theory of exponential families which underlies the special results of section 2, and Appendix B describes two approaches to computation of the proposed estimator.},

abstract = {In this paper we analyze several new methods for solving optimization problems with the objective function formed as a sum of two convex terms: one is smooth and given by a black-box oracle, and another is general but simple and its structure is known. Despite to the bad properties of the sum, such problems, both in convex and nonconvex cases, can be solved with efficiency typical for the good part of the objective. For convex problems of the above structure, we consider primal and dual variants of the gradient method (converge as O (1/k)), and an accelerated multistep version with convergence rate O (1/k2), where k isthe iteration counter. For all methods, we suggest some efficient "line search" procedures and show that the additional computational work necessary for estimating the unknown problem class parameters can only multiply the complexity of each iteration by a small constant factor. We present also the results of preliminary computational experiments, which confirm the superiority of the accelerated scheme.},

abstract = {Kernel density estimators are used for the estimation of integrals of various squared derivatives of a probability density. Rates of convergence in mean squared error are calculated, which show that appropriate values of the smoothing parameter are much smaller than those for ordinary density estimation. The rate of convergence increases with stronger smoothness assumptions, however, unlike ordinary density estimation, the parametric rate of n-1 can be achieved even when only a finite amount of differentiability is assumed. The implications for data-driven bandwidth selection in ordinary density estimation are considered.},
